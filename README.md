- The features are ranked by their importance in predicting accident risk, with the most important features at the top

* lighting_night: This feature has the highest importance, suggesting that whether it is nighttime is the most significant factor influencing accident risk in this model.
* speed_limit: The speed limit is the second most important feature, which makes intuitive sense as higher speed limits or inappropriate speeds for conditions can increase risk.
* curvature: Road curvature is also a highly important feature, indicating that the (curvature) of the road plays a significant role in predicting accident risk.
* speed_curvature_ratio: The engineered feature combining speed and curvature also shows notable importance, highlighting the interaction between these two factors.
* weather_rainy and weather_foggy: These weather conditions are important predictors, as expected, as adverse weather increases accident risk.

* Other features like lighting_dim, num_reported_accidents, road_type_rural, road_type_urban, public_road, holiday, road_signs_present, time_of_day_evening, time_of_day_morning, and num_lanes have lower importance in this specific model.
- In summary, the model suggests that lighting conditions (especially night), speed limit, and road curvature are the most influential factors in determining accident risk.
